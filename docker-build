edit .Dockerfile in a folder

if I have file say script.sh
with say:

content is:
FROM baseimage (for example baseimage=alpine)
COPY script.sh /script.sh
CMD = ["/script.sh"]                  (CMD means:  this is like the entry point to running the container)

if a command with parameters:
#CMD = ["echo", "an array with 1 or more parameters delimited by a comma"]


then time to build with:

docker build .    <== builds from the local .Dockerfile
A docker ID (long hex number) will be the unique build ID.
I can then run it with:
docker run --name test hex_id_here
